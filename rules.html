  <h1>Chess Rules Summary</h1>

  <h2> Basic Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal is to checkmate the opponent’s king.</li>
    <li><strong>Illegal Moves:</strong> You cannot move into check, leave your king in check, or capture the opponent’s king.</li>
    <li><strong>Castling:</strong> Castling is legal only if neither the king nor rook involved has moved, and no squares the king passes through are under attack.</li>
    <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> A pawn may capture another pawn en passant only on the move immediately following the opponent’s two-square pawn advance.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> A pawn reaching the eighth rank must be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight (Article 3.7e).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Clock & Timing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clock Use:</strong> A move is only completed when a player stops their own clock and starts the opponent’s.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Control:</strong> Games are lost on time if the required number of moves isn’t made in the allotted period—unless checkmate is impossible.</li>
    <li><strong>Default Time:</strong> Players arriving late may forfeit the game, often after 0 minutes unless the competition rules specify otherwise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Recording Moves</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scoresheet:</strong> Players must record their moves using algebraic notation unless they have less than 5 minutes and no increment.</li>
    <li><strong>Draw Offers:</strong> Must be recorded on the scoresheet using a symbol like "(=)".</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Draw Conditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stalemate:</strong> Occurs when a player has no legal move and is not in check.</li>
    <li><strong>Threefold Repetition:</strong> Players may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times.</li>
    <li><strong>50-Move Rule:</strong> A draw can be claimed if no pawn move or capture has occurred in 50 consecutive moves.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Irregularities & Penalties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Illegal Move:</strong> Must be corrected; the opponent may gain extra time.</li>
    <li><strong>Third Illegal Move:</strong> Results in a loss unless checkmate is impossible.</li>
    <li><strong>Electronic Devices:</strong> If a phone rings, the player loses the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Misconduct:</strong> Disruptive behavior or cheating can result in loss or expulsion.</li>
  </ul>
